## General Information

I'm a software engineer for technical-scientific applications having  _M.Sc._ degrees in _Computer Sciences_ and _Mathematics_. For software development on various platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) I mainly use the programming languages _C++_, _Java_, and _Fortran_.

### Main fields of Interest
- PDF technologies
- Database management systems (design and architecture)
- XML/XSLT processing
- I18N (Internationalization) technologies

## Open Source Projects

Since about 2005 I'm involved in _Open Source_ software development.

#### My components for [wxWidgets](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets)-based applications
  - [wxSQLite3](https://github.com/utelle/wxsqlite3) - SQLite3 wrapper (with encryption support)
  - [wxPdfDocument](https://github.com/utelle/wxpdfdoc) - Generation of PDF documents
  - [wxChartDir](https://github.com/utelle/wxchartdir) - Support for using the [ChartDirector](https://www.advsofteng.com) library

#### My C-based components
  - [SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers) - SQLite3 extension with support for multiple cipher schemes

#### My components for Python
  - [apsw-sqlite3mc](https://github.com/utelle/apsw-sqlite3mc) - a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) wrapper for _Python3_ applications, combining the SQLite wrapper [APSW](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw) of [Roger Binns](https://github.com/rogerbinns) and the SQLite encryption extension  [SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers) to allow reading and writing encrypted SQLite databases from Python applications. [apsw-sqlite3mc](https://github.com/utelle/apsw-sqlite3mc) was developed in close cooperation with [Roger Binns](https://www.rogerbinns.com).

#### Projects to which I contributed, one way or the other
  - [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl) - A library for transferring data with URL syntax
  - [libxlsxwriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter) - A C library for creating Excel XLSX files
  - [sqleet](https://github.com/resilar/sqleet) - SQLite3 encryption that sucks less
  - [wxWidgets](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets) - Cross-Platform GUI Library

#### Projects I have experiences with
  - [libexpat](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat) - Fast streaming XML parser library
  - [Lua](https://www.lua.org) - Powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language
  - [muparser](https://github.com/beltoforion/muparser) - Fast math parser library
  - [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) - Cryptography and SSL/TLS Toolkit
  - [Sablotron](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sablotron/) - XSLT processor written in C++
